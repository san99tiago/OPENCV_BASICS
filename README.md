# :camera: OPENCV PROJECTS :camera:
Some of my Computer Vision projects. The idea of this repository, is to build a solid knowledge in Computer Vision algorithms and concepts. It's developed in Python and mainly with OpenCV and Scikit-learn libraries.

# COMPUTER VISION BASICS :closed_book: :green_book: :blue_book:
This repository covers the knowledge and basic concepts of Computer-Vision applications. <br />
It begins with the necessary programming tools to understand the fundamentals for the development of Computer-Vision solutions. <br />
Then, it goes into more advanced topics and problem-solving, even with ML approaches. <br />
The information of this repository is based on many online tutorials and one of my undergraduate classes called "Artificial Vision".<br />



## Dependencies :vertical_traffic_light:
The dependencies are mainly python libraries and the correct usage of them. <br />
My advice is to primary understand the "pip" package installer, before working with other dependencies.


### Software dependencies
* VS Code <br />
Visual Studio Code is my main code editor for Python scripts and high-level programming. This is not absolutely necessary, but from my experience, it gives us a great performance and we can link it with Git and Github easily.
```
https://code.visualstudio.com/
```

* Python <br />
Python is the main programming language that let us work fast, with easy and powerful integration of different software solutions.
```
https://www.python.org/
```


### Libraries and Package dependencies


* OPENCV <br />
OpenCV is an amazing Open Computer Vision Library, that enables great tools, resources and methods to process and work with images. It is closs-platform and has multiple language connections. In these repository we will be working in Python, but you are free to work in your prefered programming language.
```
https://opencv.org/
```


* NUMPY <br />
NumPy is a great resource to work with arrays and concepts of linear algebra. This allows us to work with data and achieve scientific computing
```
https://numpy.org/
```

* MATPLOTLIB <br />
This is a great Python library for creating static, animated and interactive data visualizations in a simple way.
```
https://matplotlib.org/
```


* TKINTER <br />
Tkinter is an integrated Library that gives us a great way to create GUI windows with Python. It is also a cross-platform that has the 
advantage of working with the classic Tk windows and many libraries that integrate together to achieve amazing projects.
```
https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
```


## Usage :pencil2:
All projects are really well commented and most of them have specifications and remarks for their purpose and I/O.
I will be uploading most of the files, and try to keep it as clean as possible.


## Special thanks :gift:
* Thanks to my professor and friend: Gustavo Andres Moreno Hincapie.
* Thanks to all contributors for the great OpenSource projects that I am using.
